- pygrib
- shutil
- datetime

Notes
------------
- In param_file.py you can set the path to the folder containing pyBalloon, if you wish to change the folder names you will have to go through all the files.
- Elevation data needs to be downloaded from: http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/dem3.html#hgt


The code is setup such that it requires the following folders:
------------
- pyBalloon: contains the code.
- Output: here the output from pyBalloon is saved (this folder is created automatically).
- Weather_data: contains the GEFS and GFS folders, which contain the ensemble weather forecasts and the weather forecasts models respectively.
- SRTM_data: contains the elevation data.
